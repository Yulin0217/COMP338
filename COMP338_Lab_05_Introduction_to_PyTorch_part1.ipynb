    "Welcome to our PyTorch tutorial for the Deep Learning course 2021 at the University of Amsterdam! The following notebook is meant to give a short introduction to PyTorch basics, and get you setup for writing your own neural networks. PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework that allows you to write your own neural networks and optimize them efficiently. However, PyTorch is not the only framework of its kind. Alternatives to PyTorch include [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax#quickstart-colab-in-the-cloud) and [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/). We choose to teach PyTorch at the University of Amsterdam because it is well established, has a huge developer community (originally developed by Facebook), is very flexible and especially used in research. Many current papers publish their code in PyTorch, and thus it is good to be familiar with PyTorch as well. \n",
    "Meanwhile, TensorFlow (developed by Google) is usually known for being a production-grade deep learning library. Still, if you know one machine learning framework in depth, it is very easy to learn another one because many of them use the same concepts and ideas. For instance, TensorFlow's version 2 was heavily inspired by the most popular features of PyTorch, making the frameworks even more similar. \n",
    "If you are already familiar with PyTorch and have created your own neural network projects, feel free to just skim this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are of course not the first ones to create a PyTorch tutorial. There are many great tutorials online, including the [\"60-min blitz\"](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) on the official [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/). Yet, we choose to create our own tutorial which is designed to give you the basics particularly necessary for the practicals, but still understand how PyTorch works under the hood. Over the next few weeks, we will also keep exploring new PyTorch features in the series of Jupyter notebook tutorials about deep learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a set of standard libraries that are often used in machine learning projects. If you are running this notebook on Google Colab, all libraries should be pre-installed. If you are running this notebook locally, make sure you have installed our `dl2021` environment and have activated it."

You should therefore see the output `Using torch 1.10.0` or `Using torch 1.9.0`, eventually with some extension for the CUDA version on Colab. In case you use the `dl2021` environment, you should see `Using torch 1.10.0`. In general, it is recommended to keep the PyTorch version updated to the newest one. If you see a lower version number than 1.9, make sure you have installed the correct the environment, or ask one of your TAs.

    "* `torch.matmul`: Performs the matrix product over two tensors, where the specific behavior depends on the dimensions. If both inputs are matrices (2-dimensional tensors), it performs the standard matrix product. For higher dimensional inputs, the function supports broadcasting (for details see the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.matmul.html?highlight=matmul#torch.matmul)). Can also be written as `a @ b`, similar to numpy. \n",

    "* `torch.bmm`: Performs the matrix product with a support batch dimension. If the first tensor $T$ is of shape ($b\\times n\\times m$), and the second tensor $R$ ($b\\times m\\times p$), the output $O$ is of shape ($b\\times n\\times p$), and has been calculated by performing $b$ matrix multiplications of the submatrices of $T$ and $R$: $O_i = T_i @ R_i$\n",
    "* `torch.einsum`: Performs matrix multiplications and more (i.e. sums of products) using the Einstein summation convention. Explanation of the Einstein sum can be found in assignment 1.\n",

    "### Dynamic Computation Graph and Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main reasons for using PyTorch in Deep Learning projects is that we can automatically get **gradients/derivatives** of functions that we define. We will mainly use PyTorch for implementing neural networks, and they are just fancy functions. If we use weight matrices in our function that we want to learn, then those are called the **parameters** or simply the **weights**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our neural network would output a single scalar value, we would talk about taking the **derivative**, but you will see that quite often we will have **multiple** output variables (\"values\"); in that case we talk about **gradients**. It's a more general term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an input $\\mathbf{x}$, we define our function by **manipulating** that input, usually by matrix-multiplications with weight matrices and additions with so-called bias vectors. As we manipulate our input, we are automatically creating a **computational graph**. This graph shows how to arrive at our output from our input. \n",
    "PyTorch is a **define-by-run** framework; this means that we can just do our manipulations, and PyTorch will keep track of that graph for us. Thus, we create a dynamic computation graph along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to recap: the only thing we have to do is to compute the **output**, and then we can ask PyTorch to automatically get the **gradients**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:  Why do we want gradients?** Consider that we have defined a function, a neural net, that is supposed to compute a certain output $y$ for an input vector $\\mathbf{x}$. We then define an **error measure** that tells us how wrong our network is; how bad it is in predicting output $y$ from input $\\mathbf{x}$. Based on this error measure, we can use the gradients to **update** the weights $\\mathbf{W}$ that were responsible for the output, so that the next time we present input $\\mathbf{x}$ to our network, the output will be closer to what we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we have to do is to specify which tensors require gradients. By default, when we create a tensor, it does not require gradients."
